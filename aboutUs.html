                    <h4>Thomas Clukies</h4>
                    <p>I've recently traveled internationally and gained a new understanding, respect, and love for the Earth.
                        I have found a new love for creativity and travel. This has pushed me to explore a new field where
                        I could tap into this creative side technologically. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to broaden
                        my Finance and Information Management degrees. Taking these factors into account, I have decided
                        to pursue a career in Web Development and enroll in the Galvanize Immersive Web Development course.
                        I am excited for the opportunities that can arise from having an increased array of skills.
                        <br>
                        <br> As a student in this program I enjoy learning and growing exponentially every day. I love the style
                        of learning in this largely dynamic field. I plan to learn outside of the program bounds, and develop
                        my skills as much as possible in the coming months, and beyond. I will also be searching adamantly
                        for a career in the front end and/or back end development field around the Greater Denver Area, although
                        I am flexible with location. I'm excited about this new field and the value I can add to any firm.
                        Aside from coding, I have an intense love for all things outdoors. I enjoy travel, cooking, yoga,
                        and delicious beer. </p>

                    <h4>Crystal Preston-Watson</h4>
                    <p>I started my career in journalism. I was a freelance writer and web editor at the alt-weekly, Westword,
                        and eventually ending up at the Rocky Mountain News where I was an interactive producer until the
                        the paper closed in 2009. In 2010, made the jump to web development, working with companies in the
                        U.S. and Canada as a junior front-end developer before moving to quality assurance. Currently, I
                        am a student in the Galvanize web development immersive. In my free time you can find me playing
                        Skyrim, performing and writing improv/sketch comedy or listening to my favorite podcasts.</p>

                        things, so pursuing my interest in software development felt like a natural next step. I'm currently
                        a student in Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program, and in the coming months, hope to use
                        my coding and analytical skills to create new things and to find ways to use technology to serve
                        communities better.</p>

                    <p>After running an insurance agency for five years, I realized that I was ready for a new challenge. I've
                        always enjoyed problem solving and logic problems. In addition I've always dreamed of designing and
                        building useful tools. These two interest led me to explore the world of computer programming.
                        <br>
                        <br> I joined the Galvanize community to dive deeper. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Development Immersive
                        Program to become a full stack web developer. I enjoy learning. I have the ability to motivate myself
                        to create a new business or a new project. I have experience in starting and managing a business,
                        presenting a product, and maintaining a client base. Outside of class I am working on a development
                        team to convert a website to Angular and add new functionality. I'm always willing to support the
                        team in whatever needs to be done.
                        <br>
                        <br> When I'm not in-front of the computer, I'm outside enjoying the beautiful mountains. I enjoy hiking,
                        fly-fishing, camping, and skiing. I'm a member of social clubs for travel, learning Spanish, and
                        computer programming. I'm a believer in meditation and living a healthy lifestyle.</p>

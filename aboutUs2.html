            <p>I've recently traveled internationally and gained a new understanding, respect, and love for the Earth. I have found a new love for creativity and travel. This has pushed me to explore a new field where I could tap into this creative side technologically. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to broaden my Finance and Information Management degrees. Taking these factors into account, I have decided to pursue a career in Web Development and enroll in the Galvanize Immersive Web Development course. I am excited for the opportunities that can arise from having an increased array of skills.<br> 

              As a student in this program I enjoy learning and growing exponentially every day. I love the style of learning in this largely dynamic field. I plan to learn outside of the program bounds, and develop my skills as much as possible in the coming months, and beyond. I will also be searching adamantly for a career in the front end and/or back end development field around the Greater Denver Area, although I am flexible with location. I'm excited about this new field and the value I can add to any firm. Aside from coding, I have an intense love for all things outdoors. I enjoy travel, cooking, yoga, and delicious beer. </p>

            <p>I started my career in journalism. I was a freelance writer and web editor at the alt-weekly, Westword, and eventually ending up at the Rocky Mountain News where I was an interactive producer until the the paper closed in 2009. In 2010, made the jump to web development, working with companies in the U.S. and Canada as a junior front-end developer before moving to quality assurance. Currently, I am a student in the Galvanize web development immersive. In my free time you can find me playing Skyrim, performing and writing improv/sketch comedy or listening to my favorite podcasts.</p>

            <p>My background is in public policy and nonprofit media. I’ve always been curious and eager to learn new things, so pursuing my interest in software development felt like a natural next step. I’m currently a student in Galvanize’s Web Development Immersive program, and in the coming months, hope to use my coding and analytical skills to create new things and to find ways to use technology to serve communities better.</p>

            <p>After running an insurance agency for five years, I realized that I was ready for a new challenge. I've always enjoyed problem solving and logic problems. In addition I've always dreamed of designing and building useful tools. These two interest led me to explore the world of computer programming.<br>

I joined the Galvanize community to dive deeper. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Development Immersive Program to become a full stack web developer. I enjoy learning. I have the ability to motivate myself to create a new business or a new project. I have experience in starting and managing a business, presenting a product, and maintaining a client base. Outside of class I am working on a development team to convert a website to Angular and add new functionality. I'm always willing to support the team in whatever needs to be done.<br>

When I'm not in-front of the computer, I'm outside enjoying the beautiful mountains. I enjoy hiking, fly-fishing, camping, and skiing. I'm a member of social clubs for travel, learning Spanish, and computer programming. I'm a believer in meditation and living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
